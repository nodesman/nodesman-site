  <p>This is a RSS Feed reader written in AngularJs. This uses your browserâ€™s localStorage API to store your subscription information, which means no accounts need to be created for showing you subscriptions.
    </p>

  <p>
  The application uses a Rails 4 back-end to perform the request to the various RSS feed URLs (since it is impossible to request those URLs directly because of cross-origin request limitations in latest browsers).
